"""A stand-in for a real coding-agent harness.

The runner's job is to start one program, hand it a Markdown body on standard
input, wait for one answer, and decide what that answer means. None of that
needs a real harness, a real subscription, or a real model - it needs a program
that behaves in one chosen way. This is that program.

It is started exactly as a real peer is:

    [sys.executable, "<path>/fake_peer.py", "<mode>", ...]

It reads the whole of standard input, and then behaves according to its mode.
Every mode exists because some check needs it, and there are only two families
of them.

The first is about what a peer says: a good answer, which is whatever it was
given handed straight back; no answer at all; an answer that is nothing but
whitespace; and, for a harness that takes the message on its command line
rather than on standard input, the final argument handed straight back, with a
complaint appended if anything arrived on standard input as well. Between them
they are every shape the runner has to tell apart when it decides whether there
is anything to publish, and both ways a body can travel.

The second is about what a peer leaves behind: a program that exits badly, one
that will not stop, one that starts a child and then will not stop, and two that
report their own process id and their child's into a file the check names, so a
check can watch those exact processes rather than guessing at them. Of those
last two, one leaves the child in the process group the turn owns and one lets
it escape into a session of its own, which is the stated limit of what any
cleanup can reach.

It imports nothing outside the standard library, touches nothing except the
input it is given, the file it is told to write its process ids into, and the
output streams it is handed. It never sleeps without a bound.
