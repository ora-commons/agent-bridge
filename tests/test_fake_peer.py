"""What one turn must do, and must never do, proved against a fake peer.

None of this needs a real coding-agent harness, a subscription or a model. Every
behavior worth proving here is about files, locks and processes: that a message
is either whole or absent, that two turns cannot both hold a session, that a
lock left behind by a process that was killed outright blocks nobody, that being
told to stop cleans up what a turn started, and that nothing this turn started
is still running when it returns.

Five of the checks are about exactly *when* a stop arrives, because the awkward
moments are short ones. A stop while the child is being created, before anything
knows which process group to end. A second stop while that group is being
emptied. A stop in the instant after a message has been renamed into place,
which must never be reported as though nothing had been published. A stop inside
the removal of the temporary file a failed publication leaves behind, which must
not become a way of leaving that file on the disk. And a real termination signal
arriving in the middle of an ordinary, perfectly healthy publication - after the
temporary file has been made and before the message is moved into place - which
must not end the process outright and leave that file in the session folder.
Each is made to happen at the exact moment rather than waited for, by standing
in front of the one step it has to land on.

Two more are about publication going wrong in ways that are easy to report
untruthfully. A temporary file that will not be removed has to be named, because
otherwise nothing tells the person it is there. And a rename whose outcome
cannot be established afterwards has to be reported as exactly that - not as
"nothing was published", which would send somebody to run a command again over a
message that is already on the disk.

One is about the connector, which composes the peer command rather than handing
one over ready-made. Whatever a connector starts in order to do that - asking
the harness its version, whether it is signed in, whether the restriction
switches are there - is bounded by the turn's own deadline, and a builder that
outruns that deadline never gets a peer started and never publishes a request.

Three groups are about the one transport that is not standard input. A harness
whose program has no standard-input path may take the body as its final
command-line argument, on conditions that can all be seen from outside without
the real program: the body arrives whole as exactly one argument, behind
whatever prefix the connector said, with nothing on standard input, even when
it begins with hyphens or carries the program's own option names; a body too
large for the whole argument block, or holding a NUL byte, is refused before
any request is published and is never cut down, because a request on the disk
would say something had been sent; and a peer that is given no project is
refused one by the command itself, before anything is read or started.

The last group is about the other way something gets into a session: `record`,
which creates the immutable Format 2 header or writes one neutral note. The
two-kind list is closed, arbitrary valid initiator labels need no registration,
and legacy Format 1 structure is rejected rather than migrated.

Everything below exercises the real thing. Real processes are started, real
files are written, real locks are taken out in separate processes, real signals
are sent, and a real process is killed with no chance to tidy up. The exceptions
are the forced publication outcomes, which cannot be produced on demand any
other way and are made to happen by breaking, or by interrupting, the rename and
the flush that follows it, for the length of one call.

        nothing to say it was there.

        Nothing is broken in this check. The publication is an ordinary healthy
