"""One courier call derived entirely from an immutable session.

The runner validates the body and connector transport before publishing the
request. It then starts one fresh target process, publishes one final textual
answer, and exits. A failed target leaves the truthful request and no invented
response. There is no retry or implicit history.

Ordinary work has no elapsed-time deadline: the turn waits until the peer
answers, fails, or somebody stops it. A caller may instead name a bounded
wait, and that wait never kills anything - when it ends the turn is returned
to the caller as a `PendingTurn` holding the still-running peer together
with the retained session evidence, and the caller collects, re-waits,
cancels, or detaches.

A Format 3 session may be a work session: the runner hands the connector's
work builder the session's declared directories and explicit attachments,
publishes the caller's inert note reference and purpose in the request header,
and marks the response with the request sequence it answers. A caller that
asked for lifecycle events gets `started`, periodic `heartbeat` check-ins, and
one `finished` event - the last only after durable publication or an honest
failure, so a broken event pipe can never make an unfinished call look
finished.

When a target's own structured output reports which model and provider
answered, that reported identity is preserved rather than discarded after
validation: the finished event carries it as optional `model` and `provider`
fields, and a Format 3 response record carries it as `Model:` and `Provider:`
header lines. Each half appears only when the tool reported it, never as an
empty placeholder, and the published response body stays the final text alone.
