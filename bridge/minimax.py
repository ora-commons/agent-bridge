"""The hand-written MiniMax Code courier connector.

MiniMax Code 0.2.7 has a stable headless ``mcode exec`` transport, but no
headless permission mode that confines its tools. Agent Bridge therefore gives
it only a task-owned neutral directory and reports the remaining tool and
configuration authority instead of presenting ``smart`` as a sandbox.
