"""Calling Claude Code with its strongest practical read-only posture.

Claude Code is Anthropic's own command-line program for its coding agent. This
module is the whole of what Agent Bridge knows about it: which program to start,
which switches must be on it, and how to tell - without spending a model turn -
whether starting it would work at all.

There are two operations here and nothing else. `check` answers whether Claude
Code could be used right now. `build_command` composes the one fixed argument
vector a turn runs. Both do the same inexpensive prerequisites first, because a
turn that skipped them would find out about a missing sign-in or a renamed
switch in the middle of real work, with the peer already running.

**How the answer comes back.** `--print` with no prompt argument reads the
prompt from standard input, and `--output-format text` puts the final answer,
and only the final answer, on standard output; everything the program has to say
about itself goes to the error stream. That separation is what lets the runner
publish what it captured as the peer's reply, word for word.

**The switches, and why none of them is decoration.**

`--restricted` is the one that carries most of the weight. It takes away the
built-in tools that run commands or code, and WebFetch with them, unless
`--tools` names them back - which this connector never does. It ignores the
user's, the project's and the local settings files, so a turn is not shaped by
whatever happens to be configured on the machine. It confines the file tools to
the working directory the process was started in. And it refuses the
permission mode that would bypass permission checks altogether.
Administrator-managed endpoint and remote policy deliberately survive this
mode, so the connector observes their presence or uncertainty without opening
policy values and reports that boundary as a warning. The exact
``managed-mcp.json`` source is different: this CLI exits when strict MCP is
combined with it, so its presence or an unreadable pathname is refused before
request publication.

`--strict-mcp-config` says to use only the MCP servers named by `--mcp-config`.
No `--mcp-config` is passed, so that set is empty: the turn reaches no MCP
server at all, whatever is configured elsewhere.

`--tools Read,Glob,Grep` says which of the built-in tools survive. Reading files,
finding them by name, and searching inside them are all a peer needs to inspect a
repository and answer about it. Everything that edits, runs, fetches, publishes
or messages is simply not there.

`--permission-mode plan` is the harness's own enforced read-only posture, put on
top of the three above rather than instead of them. Defaults are never trusted
here: every one of these is passed on every call, even though some of them
overlap.

Five switches are deliberately never passed. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
and `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` undo the boundary outright.
`--continue` and `--resume` would carry a previous conversation into this turn,
and every call Agent Bridge makes is a fresh one - the session record on disk is
the memory, not the harness's own history. `--bare` is the surprising one: it
sounds like less, but it abandons subscription sign-in and insists on an API
key instead, which is the opposite of leaving the harness's own authentication
where it already lives.

**There is no working-directory switch, and none is needed.** Claude Code works
in the directory its process was started in, so that directory is the mechanism,
and `--restricted` is what confines the file tools to it.

**What readiness costs.** Nothing. Four cheap questions, no model turn among
them: where the program is, `claude --version`, `claude auth status --json`, and
`claude --help`. The sign-in answer is JSON, so it is read rather than guessed
at: being signed in is required, and how - by subscription rather than by an API
key - is reported as an observed fact and gates nothing, because choosing
providers is not this project's business.
